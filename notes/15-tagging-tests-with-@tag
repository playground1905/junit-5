- Tagging for your test is the thing that helps you with managing your tests and selectively running test depending on what you have going on 
- Tagging let's you tag your test as the name says with certain words and then you can say okay Ä± want to tag my tests as important and then you have a way of running only your important test at any point of time. 
- This is useful when you have a lot of tests or maybe have unit tests and integration tests you can say this is a unit test and run all your unit tests seperately from your integration test

    @Test
    @DisplayName("Testing add method")
    @Tag("Math")
    void testAdd() {
        int expected = 2;
        int actual = mathUtils.add(1, 1);
        assertEquals(expected, actual, "The add method should add two numbers");
    }
