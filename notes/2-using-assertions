Expectation vs Actual 
- Create an instance of hte class under test.
- Set up inputs.
- Execute the code you want to test.
- Verify the result is what you expect.

assertEquals(espected, actual) : Asserts that expected and actual are equal.
assertArrayequals(expectedArray, actualArray): Verifies each item in the arrays are equal in the right position.
assertIterableEquals(expectedArray, actualArray): Verifies each item in the iterable are equal in the corresponding positions.
assertFalse(boolean condition, String message): Assert that the supplied condition is false.
assertNotEquals(byte unexpected, byte actual)
assertNotNull(Object actual)
fail() : Fails the test.

There is a way check if a method throws an exception like it's supposed to throw right
sometimes taht exception is required you want your method throw an exception when something happens.
How do you validate it is throwing the right exception so for that you use a thing called "assertThrows"
assertThrows(expectedExceptionType, executable, message);
