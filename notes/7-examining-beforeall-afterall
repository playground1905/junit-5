While executing tests on MathUtilsTest class;
JUnit creates a new instance of MathUtilsTest
MathUtilsTest mathUtilsTest = new MathUtilsTest and then 
- scan annotations @Beforeeach so I'm going to run that method called the "init" before each method

I'm just running test and creates a new instance runs init runs test and runs cleanup when is the beforeall and afterall running?
- it(@beforeall) runs before the instance is created
- after all the tests are run after the instance is terminated.

@BeforeAll methods that execute even "before" the instance is created. (@BeforeAll methods must be static because it runs before instance creation)
@AfterAll methods work all the tests are run after the instance is terminated.
